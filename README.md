# Predicting Systolic Blood Pressure (SBP) using linear and logistic regression

This project explores the prediction of Systolic Blood Pressure (SBP) using statistical modeling and visualization techniques. It combines linear regression and logistic regression to understand relationships between features and to predict the likelihood of high blood pressure.

This project demonstrates my ability to process data, build predictive models and derive insights that align with business needs.

## Project Overview
This project demonstrates:
- Rescaling numerical features to improve model performance.
- Building linear regression models to predict SBP.
- Analyzing interaction effects between variables.
- Logistic regression to predict high blood pressure risk.
- Visualization of results using scatter plots and regression lines.
  

## Data Description
The dataset used in this project is sourced from the fram dataset. Key columns include:
- `SBP`: Systolic Blood Pressure
- `DBP`: Diastolic Blood Pressure
- `FRW`: A persons weight relevant to SBP
- `CHOL`: Cholesterol levels
- `SEX`: Gender of individuals (male/female)
- `AGE`: Age of individuals

## Key Features and Methods
1. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Rescaling of numerical columns.
   - Combining original and scaled data.

2. **Linear Regression Models**:
   - Single-variable and multi-variable models.
   - Interaction terms to explore variable relationships.

3. **Logistic Regression for High Blood Pressure Prediction**:
   - Binary classification based on SBP and DBP thresholds.

4. **Visualizations**:
   - Scatter plots with regression lines for different age and sex groups.
   - Probability curves for high blood pressure predictions.
